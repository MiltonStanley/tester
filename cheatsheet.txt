rake db:migrate				#6.1 - runs migration

#6.5 - validation of required fields, rest of 6 various useful things
	# Details at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html
	#In model, add:
	validates [property], [HELPERS, ie. ':presence => true']


##### Generating ANOTHER Model (7.1)

rails generate model Name [params- property:type]
# This only makes the model, not the views etc., - good for tying one model into another (comments to post example)
	## CREATES 
	# db/migrate/[timestamp]_create_[names].rb
	# app/models/[name].rb
	# various test_units
	# Will have to manually do views
	#
	# Then run the following to set up database:

rake db:migrate

##### Tying one model to another:
# same as making another one; but add [superior]:references in model.rb


##### ADDING TO A MODEL (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10352832/adding-a-new-field-to-rails-model)

rails generate migration Add[Field]To[Model] [field]:[class]
	# cf rails generate migration AddPositionToEmployee position:string
	# Will still have to manually edit views, found in app/views/[name]s
			# index.html.erb
			# show.html.erb
			# _form.html.erb
	# And finally the actual model, in app/models/[name].rb
